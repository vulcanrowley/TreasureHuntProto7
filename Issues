-- load up on server - ONGOING
-- wall collision not working in mouse click movement
--- turns out that tweens dont play well with colliders,
----- resolution: leverage setTileIndexCallback - use callback to turn off tween when it hits a wall - well not so easy

-- otherPlayer update not working - FIXED but sends lots of data to server
